## 2026-10-10 — Phase 0

### D-001 Bundled model licenses verified on model cards
- **Decision:** keep the SPEC defaults; all four model cards state a permissive license.
  | Capability | Model | Revision | License (card) |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Embeddings | `google/embeddinggemma-2` | `914f7f89142e` | Apache-2.0 |
  | Reranker | `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-xsmall-v1` | `b5c6e9da73ab` | Apache-2.0 |
  | Grounding | `vectara/hallucination_evaluation_model` (HHEM-2.1-Open) | `de9a5e6ba9ba` | Apache-2.0 (base `google/flan-t5-base`, Apache-2.0) |
  | STT | `Cactus-Compute/whistle` via `cactus-needle` 3.2.0 | `ca5287601bef` | Apache-2.0 (engine `Cactus-Compute/needle3`, Apache-2.0) |
- **Reason:** SPEC §2 requires card-level verification. Note: EmbeddingGemma **2** is Apache-2.0, unlike
  EmbeddingGemma 1 (`embeddinggemma-300m`), which uses the Gemma license and is gated.
- **Alternatives:** the SPEC fallbacks (all MIT/Apache-2.0) remain wired in case a default fails to run.

### D-002 Phase 0 bakes only the four bundled models; Docling arrives in Phase 1
- **Decision:** the Phase 0 image contains embeddings, reranker, grounding and STT models. Docling (and its
  layout models) is added in Phase 1 with the parsers.
- **Reason:** Phase 0 scope is foundations; parsing is Phase 1. Keeps the first image smaller.

### D-003 LAN endpoints count as "remote"
- **Decision:** locality is `local` only for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `host.docker.internal`.
  Any other host, including private LAN IPs, is `remote`.
- **Reason:** SPEC §6 rule; data that leaves the machine is shown as remote (data safety).

### D-004 SearXNG settings via a one-shot init service using the app image
- **Decision:** `compose.yaml` has a `searxng-init` service (same app image) that writes `settings.yml`
  (with a freshly generated `secret_key`) into a named volume if missing; SearXNG waits for it.
- **Reason:** SPEC §4 requires `compose.yaml` to work when downloaded alone. If SearXNG started first it
  would write its own default settings (JSON off, limiter on) and the app could not fix them without a race.
  No extra image, SearXNG stays unmodified.
- **Alternatives:** app writes the file and SearXNG `depends_on` the app (inverts the SPEC dependency and
  needs a health check); bind-mount from the data folder (same race).

### D-005 Container drops privileges to the owner of `/data`
- **Decision:** entrypoint runs as root only long enough to read the owner of `/data`; if it is a non-root
  uid, the app runs as that uid/gid (via `setpriv`), else it keeps running as root.
- **Reason:** on Linux hosts files in `~/Trustbook` stay owned by the user (handover = zip the folder);
  Windows/macOS bind mounts are unaffected.

### D-006 CI Docker build check skips model download
- **Decision:** `ci.yml` builds the image with `--build-arg BAKE_MODELS=0`; `release.yml` builds the full
  image with baked models.
- **Reason:** avoid downloading ~2 GB of models twice on every push; the release build exercises the full path.

### D-007 Playwright e2e test lands in Phase 1
- **Decision:** the SPEC e2e scenario (paste text → cited answer) needs Phase 1 features; Playwright is set up then.

### D-008 Whistle STT runs pinned, offline and with telemetry off
- **Decision:** bake the Whistle weights (`Cactus-Compute/whistle@ca5287601bef`) and the Needle engine
  (`libneedle3.so` extracted from `Cactus-Compute/needle3@8354babbfb92`, wheel `cactus_needle-3.3.0`) into the
  image. Load them with `needle.Whistle(weights=<path>)` and `NEEDLE3_LIB_PATH`. Set `NEEDLE_TELEMETRY=0`
  and `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` in the image.
- **Reason:** by default `cactus-needle` downloads the engine and weights unpinned from `main` and re-fetches a
  `config.json` (a download counter) on every load. Its module-level `needle.transcribe` also sends telemetry
  to a third-party endpoint. SPEC forbids telemetry and network calls the user did not configure. The
  `Whistle` class methods never call telemetry; offline use was verified with no network namespace.
- **Also:** Whistle is not thread-safe, so STT calls are serialised behind a lock. On non-speech audio it can
  invent a short phrase ("Thank you."), so Phase 1 adds a voice-activity check before STT.

### D-009 Licenses of transitive dependencies
- **Decision:** direct dependencies must be MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD or Unlicense. Transitive dependencies with
  equivalent permissive licenses (ISC, PSF-2.0, HPND/MIT-CMU, 0BSD) or file-level weak copyleft used
  unmodified (MPL-2.0, e.g. `certifi`) are accepted and listed in `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`.
- **Reason:** `transformers`/`sentence-transformers` cannot load EmbeddingGemma 2 without Pillow (HPND) and
  torchvision, and `httpx` needs `certifi` (MPL-2.0). There is no allowlisted alternative, and these
  licenses impose no obligations beyond attribution for unmodified use.
- **Alternatives:** dropping to the fallback embedding model would not remove Pillow/certifi.

### D-010 Embeddings run in FP32 by default
- **Decision:** FP32 everywhere (never FP16). BF16 is ~2.7× faster on CPUs with native BF16, but most laptops
  lack it. It may become an opt-in setting later.
- **Model notes:** text-only load (`vision_config`/`audio_config` = None, 271M params). The full 1.49 GB
  weights file must still be downloaded because it is a single unsharded file. Reranker scores are already
  0..1 (sentence-transformers applies a sigmoid). HHEM's tokenizer comes from a pinned, tokenizer-only copy of
  `google/flan-t5-base`, because its remote code otherwise fetches it unpinned.

### D-011 Pinned ML runtime set
- `torch 2.14.1+cpu`, `torchvision 0.29.1+cpu`, `transformers 5.19.0`, `sentence-transformers 6.1.0`,
  `tokenizers 0.23.3`, `huggingface-hub 1.33.0`, `safetensors 0.8.0`, `numpy 2.5.3`, `pillow 12.3.0`,
  `cactus-needle 3.2.0`. All four models were verified together in one process with no network access
  (RSS ~2.7 GB, so the app container needs at least 4 GB RAM).

### D-012 Frontend contract interpretations
- **Decision:** the backend returns every field a capability can have, and the UI hides the ones that don't
  apply to the unsaved form (API key only when the preset needs one, API version only for Azure, gate endpoint
  fields only when not reusing chat, and so on). An API key left empty is not sent, so the saved key is kept;
  "Remove saved key" sends `""`. Pause and cancel apply to queued and running jobs, and reordering applies to
  queued jobs only. The last opened space stays active, because clearing it on navigation races in StrictMode.
- **Reason:** switching presets must not need a round trip, and an empty password field must never erase a key.

### D-013 Frontend dependencies
- **Decision:** icons come from `@tabler/icons-react` (MIT) instead of shadcn's default `lucide-react`
  (ISC, not on the allowlist). Production dependencies are 48 MIT, 1 Apache-2.0 and 1 0BSD (`tslib`, pulled
  in by Radix, accepted under D-009). TypeScript is pinned to 6.0.x because typescript-eslint does not yet
  support 7.

### D-014 FastAPI's OpenTelemetry dependency stays inert
- **Decision:** accept `opentelemetry-api`, which FastAPI's core now requires. Never install
  `fastapi[standard]` or any OpenTelemetry SDK or exporter. The image also sets `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true`.
- **Reason:** the API package on its own is a no-op that cannot export anything. SPEC requires no telemetry.

### D-015 SearXNG engines and pinning
- **Decision:** pin `searxng/searxng:2026.10.9-f4822b3fc@sha256:85492ba8…` and keep only DuckDuckGo, Brave,
  Bing (switched on explicitly) and Wikipedia. JSON output is on, the limiter and image proxy are off, and the
  port is not published.
- **Reason:** this release disables Startpage and Mojeek upstream (CAPTCHA). Several general engines give
  fallback when one rate-limits (DuckDuckGo and Brave were rate-limited from the dev host; Bing answered).

### D-016 Startup probe for SearXNG; bundled status checks the runtime
- **Decision:** at startup the app calls SearXNG's `/healthz` (retrying for about a minute while it boots) and
  stores the result as the card's last test. Bundled capabilities show an error when the ML runtime is not
  installed, not only when model files are missing.
- **Reason:** Gate 0 needs every card to show its real status. `/healthz` sends no search words to any engine.

### D-017 Release build details
- **Decision:** release images are a single plain `linux/amd64` manifest (`provenance: false`), built with the
  GitHub Actions layer cache. The CI image check builds without models (D-006). The download script is mounted
  for its build step only, not copied into the image. The model self-check runs with `--network=none`.
- **Podman:** `service_completed_successfully` (used by `searxng-init`) needs podman-compose ≥ 1.1 or Podman
  with the docker-compose provider. This is noted in the README.
