# Gates

Each phase ends at a gate (SPEC §14). Ludwig verifies it on his laptop with the published `-rc` image and
reports **pass** or **fail**.

---

## Gate 0 — Foundations

**Image:** `ghcr.io/ludwich/trustbook:phase-0-rc` · **PR:** `phase-0 → main`

**Criteria (SPEC §14):** the stack starts with one command; the wizard Test succeeds against Ludwig's endpoint;
every capability card shows the correct status and badge; creating and deleting a space creates and removes its
folder.

### Setup (once)

1. Make a folder, e.g. `C:\Users\<you>\trustbook-gate`, and put two files from the `phase-0` branch in it:
   `compose.yaml` and `.env.example` (renamed to `.env`).
2. Edit `.env` (forward slashes, no `~`):
   ```
   GITHUB_OWNER=ludwich
   TRUSTBOOK_IMAGE_TAG=phase-0-rc
   TRUSTBOOK_PORT=8484
   TRUSTBOOK_BROWSE_ROOT=C:/Users/<you>
   TRUSTBOOK_DATA=C:/Users/<you>/Trustbook
   ```
3. Docker Desktop needs at least 4 GB of memory for its VM (Settings → Resources). The first pull is a few GB.

### Checklist

| # | Check | How to verify | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Stack starts with one command | `docker compose pull` then `docker compose up -d`; then `docker compose ps -a` | `app` is `running (healthy)` within about a minute, `searxng` is `running`, `searxng-init` has `Exited (0)` |
| 2 | UI loads | Open <http://localhost:8484> | The setup wizard opens |
| 3 | Wizard Test succeeds | Step 1: choose your provider (llama-server: `http://192.168.155.52:8080`, or `http://host.docker.internal:8080` if it runs on the laptop). Press **Load models**, pick the model, press **Test** | Green result: "Connected. The model replied in N s." The first call may take up to ~20 s while the server loads the model. Then **Save**, keep the defaults in step 2, **Finish** |
| 4 | Capability cards: status | Open **Settings** | Chat model: Ready. Gate model: Ready ("Uses the chat model"). Embeddings, Reranker, Grounding checker, Speech-to-text: Ready. Web search: Ready ("SearXNG is running" after its startup check). Text-to-speech is hidden |
| 5 | Capability cards: badges | Same page | Chat model and Gate model: **Remote** for a LAN or cloud address, **Local** for `localhost` / `host.docker.internal`. All bundled models and built-in SearXNG: **Local** |
| 6 | Test on each card | Press **Test** on every card | Every card succeeds. Web search may report 0 results if the search engines rate-limit your IP; that still counts as working |
| 7 | Create space → folder | Spaces → **New space** "Gate test" → open it, then go back | Folder `C:\Users\<you>\Trustbook\spaces\gate-test\` exists with `space.json`, `space.db`, `sources\`, `vectors\`, `ideas\` |
| 8 | Delete space → folder gone | Delete "Gate test" (confirm) | The folder `spaces\gate-test` is gone |
| 9 | Keys stay out of spaces | Look in `C:\Users\<you>\Trustbook\config\settings.json` (if you used a key) and in the space folder | The key appears only in `config\settings.json` |
| 10 | Request log | Settings → **Request log** | One entry per Test you ran against the chat endpoint (host, bytes, excerpt "Reply with OK") and SearXNG; never an API key |
| 11 | Calibration | Settings → **Speed test** | Status done; embedding chunks/s, rerank pairs/s and speech-to-text speed are filled; parse speed is empty ("Document parser arrives in Phase 1") |

Optional: `docker compose down` then `docker compose up -d`. Settings, spaces and the request log are kept,
and calibration does not run again.

### Builder results (on the dev workbench, before handing over)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| CI on `phase-0` (ruff, mypy --strict, 216 pytest, ESLint, typecheck, 52 Vitest, image build check) | green |
| Full image build, offline model self-check (`bundled_check`: embeddings, reranker, grounding, STT transcribes the JFK clip exactly) | pass |
| `docker compose -f compose.dev.yaml up` → app healthy, searxng-init exits 0, SearXNG answers JSON | pass |
| Wizard Test against `http://192.168.155.52:8080` (Qwen3-8B, llama-server) | pass (16.9 s cold, 5.1 s warm) |
| All bundled Tests + SearXNG Test in the container | pass |
| Fresh install: **Load models** lists the llama-server models before any model is saved | pass |
| Headless-browser walk of the wizard, spaces, settings and queue at 1024 px and 1440 px, light and dark, against the real stack | pass (3 UI bugs found and fixed) |
| `ghcr.io/ludwich/trustbook:phase-0-rc` pullable anonymously (package is public) | pass |
| Space create/delete creates/removes `spaces/<slug>/` | pass |
| Files in the data folder owned by the host user; `settings.json` mode 600 | pass |

### Known issues (not gate blockers)

- STT speed in containers whose CPU limit is smaller than the CPUs they can see (e.g. `--cpus`, nested LXC) is
  much slower than it should be (D-019). On Docker Desktop this does not apply.
- Web search results depend on public engines; from some IPs DuckDuckGo and Brave rate-limit (D-015).
